## Things I would refactor
Given more time to to focus on this application and make it better I would abstract the state logic out of the main App component and place it into a the AppState component and utilize react context to make the app state more accessible to nested components and to avoid additional prop drilling.

Also, I would leverage a data storage resource like mongo cloud or firestore to store and return the submitted tweets for each user. as well as update the search and delete functionality.
